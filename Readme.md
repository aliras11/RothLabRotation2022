this repository contains all the data analysis performed during my rotation in the Roth lab

chek2casecontrol_figs.R is an R script that was used to make figures for associations between  functional scores and age of onset or estrogen receptor status. The data came from matching  corresponding functional scores to the cases in the case control study for chek2.
